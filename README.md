# DNS-Lookup-System
DNS Lookup System is a Python-based project that performs manual DNS resolution using socket programming. It allows users to resolve domain names into their corresponding IP addresses without relying on built-in DNS libraries, providing a clear understanding of how the DNS protocol operates internally. The project includes both a command-line tool and a Flask-based web interface, enabling users to perform DNS lookups, measure response times, and log query results. It supports multiple record types (A, AAAA, CNAME) and compares performance across different DNS servers such as Google (8.8.8.8) and Cloudflare (1.1.1.1). This project demonstrates core networking concepts like UDP communication, DNS query construction, and response parsing, making it ideal for students and developers exploring computer networks and protocol-level programming.
